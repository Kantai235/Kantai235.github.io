## Summary

{{< lead >}}
As a Senior Backend Engineer, I specialize in developing robust applications using PHP and Laravel. My technical spectrum extends beyond the backend; I am also proficient in building microservices with Python and Flask, and possess native app development skills in Swift and Kotlin, making me a developer with a full-stack mindset.

I am passionate about exploring new language features and design patterns, firmly believing that a diverse technical perspective is the cornerstone of making excellent architectural decisions. In my development philosophy, I prioritize the long-term value of code: for existing projects, I first integrate with and respect the current architecture to ensure a stable development pace. When initiating new projects, I focus on upfront architectural design, pursuing system scalability and maintainability to effectively manage technical debt.

In my workflow, I am accustomed to using the Scrum methodology for progress management, enabling me to advance projects systematically, whether working independently or in a team. I believe that combining clear goal-planning with agile iteration and adjustment is the best practice for ensuring project success.

## Skills Overview

| Category | Technologies & Concepts | Proficiency |
|---|---|---|
| Backend Architecture | **Languages**: PHP, Python <br />**Frameworks**: Laravel, Flask, Django <br />**Databases**: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL <br />**Caching**: Redis | Proficient |
| Frontend Development | Vue.js, JavaScript (ES6+), SCSS, Webpack | Familiar |
| Mobile Development | Kotlin, Android SDK, Swift | Experienced |
| Scripting & Automation | Python, Flask | Experienced |
| DevOps & Tools | Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions, Docker, Jenkins | Experienced |
| Cloud Platforms | AWS, GCP | Experienced |

### Core Expertise

My core expertise lies in backend system development, with a focus on architectural robustness, maintainability, and future scalability.
- **System Architecture & Design**: Leading API design and development with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) at the core to ensure a clear code structure that aligns closely with business requirements.
- **Performance & Reliability**: Possessing hands-on experience with Load Balancing and High Availability systems to handle high-traffic challenges and ensure service stability.
- **Database & Optimization**: Experienced in the full lifecycle of database management, from initial design and setup to performance bottleneck analysis and in-depth optimization.

### Frontend-Backend Collaboration

I have led and practiced the modernization of frontend-backend collaboration models. The evolution is as follows:
- **Traditional API Phase**: Proficient in RESTful API design principles, responsible for developing standalone APIs for frontend consumption (e.g., by Vue/React).
- **Adopting Livewire**: To simplify development in specific scenarios, I introduced Laravel Livewire. By controlling frontend interactions directly from the backend, it effectively reduces the development and maintenance costs of APIs for smaller projects or internal admin panels.
- **Embracing Inertia.js**: In pursuit of ultimate development efficiency and user experience, I fully adopted Inertia.js as a core technology. This architecture allows Laravel controllers to directly pass data to and render frontend Vue/React components, achieving an **API-less** development model that perfectly merges the power of a backend framework with all the advantages of an SPA.

## Open Source Projects

### Init.Engineer

An anonymous communication platform built for the engineer community, dedicated to providing a safe and free space for every engineer to share their most authentic workplace stories and personal thoughts.

#### Core Features

- **Latest Articles Wall**:
    This section displays all submissions that have passed community review. The content covers the full spectrum of an engineer's work life, technical insights, project challenges, and interesting anecdotes, offering a glimpse into the real world of engineering and fostering a sense of community.

- **Crowd-sourcing Review Zone**:
    This is the platform's most distinctive feature. All new submissions first enter this zone to be reviewed and voted on by the wider community members, who decide if an article makes it to the "Latest Articles Wall." This mechanism ensures content quality and community autonomy.

- **Cross-Platform Content Distribution**:
    Once an article is approved, the system automatically syncs and publishes it to major social media platforms (like Facebook, Discord, Telegram, Plurk, etc.), maximizing the reach and impact of every post.

### PHP Design Patterns

A hands-on, open-source repository featuring 31 design patterns. This project not only covers the classic 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns but also incorporates the author's unique insights and several practical, modern patterns.

Its key feature is the inclusion of comprehensive test cases for each pattern. This allows learners not only to understand the pattern's structure but also to validate boundary conditions and deepen their understanding of its responsibilities by writing and running tests. It's an excellent resource for simultaneously enhancing both architectural design and testing skills.

### Laravel High-Traffic & High-Concurrency Study

This project contrasts the bottlenecks of a traditional MVC architecture connected directly to a database under high concurrency. It provides a complete demonstration of how to use Redis caching and Message Queues to process requests asynchronously, achieving system decoupling, peak shaving, and load leveling.

The ultimate goal is to build a robust backend architecture capable of gracefully handling instantaneous high traffic, providing a runnable architectural blueprint for developers facing similar challenges.

    {{< timelineItem header="Panelist" badge="MOPCON" subheader="2020" >}}
        Invited as a panelist for the "Side Projects" forum. For many engineers, seeing a problem and immediately trying to solve it is a habit, whether it occurs in daily life, society, or even in online games with friends. As engineers with problem-solving skills, how do we identify the crux of an issue and develop programs that help ourselves and others? How do we maintain these projects and even generate income from them? Let's talk about what side projects are all about!
